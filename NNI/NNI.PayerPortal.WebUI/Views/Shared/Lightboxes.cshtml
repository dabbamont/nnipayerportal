            Disclaimer & Privacy</h1>
        <h2>
            1. Privacy Policy & Disclaimer</h2>
        ﻿ Dear Visitor, at Novo Nordisk we respect and protect your privacy. This website
        has been created to provide information about our company, products and services.
        This privacy policy describes how and why we collect information about you as a
        user. This privacy statement applies only to information gathered on this site.
        We strongly encourage you to read the privacy statements of every site you visit
        that gathers personally identifiable information.
        <h2>
            2. Why we gather information</h2>
        ﻿ We at Novo Nordisk strive to make a difference and improve the life of millions
        of people affected by diabetes and other illnesses around the world. We use information
        about our visitors to improve our products and gather vital information that could
        help us improve our websites. Being an industry leader in Corporate Social Responsibility
        we take your privacy seriously, and we only collect and keep information as long
        as we need it for a specific task. We will never transfer or sell personally identifiable
        information about our visitors to a third party unless we explicitly state so at
        the time of collection, or ask for your permission before doing so.
        <h2>
            3. Two types of information</h3> Some information we ask you for directly, but other
            information is collected automatically. All information collected automatically
            is stored in an aggregate form and can not be used to identify you as a specific
            individual. To provide additional functionality on our websites, answer your enquiries,
            and improve our products, we occasionally ask you to provide us with information
            that can at times be personally identifiable and sensitive. As a result, information
            gathered by us can be divided into two main categories: personally identifiable
            and sensitive information, and aggregated visitor statistics. We do not link aggregated
            visitor statistics with personally identifiable and sensitive information.
            <h2>
                Aggregated visitor statistics</h2>
            ﻿ When you visit one of our websites, we automatically collect general information
            about your computer and its location, as well as where you came from. This information
            can not be used to identify you as an individual. This information is only used
            in aggregate form to tell us where our visitors come from, what they look at, and
            where they spend the most time. This allows us to improve our websites to create
            a better experience for you. Information we gather automatically: Your referrer
            (i.e. where you came from, e.g. Google) Date and time of your visit Your regional
            and language settings (to determine which country you are in) Operating System (Windows,
            OS X, Linux etc.) Browser & Browser Version (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera,
            Safari etc.) Screen Resolution (1280x1024, 1024x768, etc.) JavaScript support Java
            support Visitor ID (Provided by a cookie we place on your computer when possible,
            helps us measure how many visitors return to our websites) IP address (Your computers
            address on the internet) The title of the page you are viewing The URL of the page
            you are viewing
            <h2>
                Personally identifiable information</h2>
            ﻿ At times, we need to collect more personal information about you. Some of our
            websites might require you to register in order to log in, in which case you will
            be required to provide personal information about yourself to us. We might also
            collect your name and email address to enter you into a prize draw for a survey
            that you fill out on our site. We might ask you for information such as your age
            and occupation to better understand our visitors, and to improve your visitor experience.
            Typically, the information we ask for includes some of the following, but this list
            is not exhaustive: Contact details, such as your name and e-mail/ postal address
            Basic information about you, such as age and gender Health and Treatment data Other
            information may also be asked, when relevant, and could include information about
            lifestyle or the household you live in as these impact aspects of managing medical
            conditions. In any case, whenever we ask you for any personally information that
            can be used to identify you as an individual, we will always provide an explanation
            as to why we gather the information, how we gather it, how we store it, and how
            we plan on treating and using it. We will only gather this information if you specifically
            agree to ‘opt-in’, i.e. you explicitly give us your consent to collect this information
            from you. We will not gather any personally identifiable information from you unless
            you specifically agree to provide it to us. We will only gather and store personally
            identifiable information for the purpose stated during the gathering process. When
            we finish processing your information for the stated purpose, we will erase and
            destroy it to ensure your privacy. There is always a lot of information that a company
            can ask you for, but Novo Nordisk will only ask for information where there is a
            clear and necessary need for that information, which is clearly and adequately explained
            to you. You will always have a choice as to what information you provide. Also,
            you can write to us and ask for a summary of information we have that relates to
            you or, if the site does not provide the opportunity for you to directly edit information
            you provided, contact us to have information deleted or modified.
            <h2>
                4. How we gather information</h2>
            ﻿ There are three main ways in which we gather information. They will be explained
            below.
            <h3>
                Server logs</h3>
            ﻿ As with most other web sites, our servers keep logs over which files were downloaded,
            and which computers downloaded those files. Information gathered by our servers
            can be analysed and used to create aggregate visitor statistics which we use for
            evaluating and improving our sites.
            <h3>
                Javascripts</h3>
            ﻿ We use a javascript based visitor tracking solution called Omniture Site Catalyst
            developed by Adobe. This software uses cookies on your computer together with small
            javascripts on our pages that are executed every time you click somewhere on our
            site. We use this software for tracking clickstream data and analysing various patterns
            of user behaviour, which is vital to our understanding of our visitor's needs and
            interest, and our ability to improve our sites. Aggregate visitor information is
            sent by your computer to secure servers owned by Adobe. Only Novo Nordisk and Adobe
            are allowed to access this data. Sale or transfer of any data to a third party is
            strictly forbidden.
            <h3>
                Cookies</h3>
            ﻿ A cookie is a small text file that is stored by us on your computer for record-keeping
            purposes. Our javascript visitor tracking solution uses cookies as a way of identifying
